The data available includes prices, volume traded, winning status, average weighted price, BSP, and a variety of other details that are valuable for modelling and strategy development. We know that the process of downloading and extracting these data files can be a bit intimidating the first time round, so here's a walk through of one way to go about it to help make it more accessible. Data tiers There are three tiers of historic data available on this site. You can download samples of each tier of data here . The biggest differece is between the free and paid data. The free data includes a lot of information about the market, but no volume, and only last traded price per minute, not a full price ladder. The two paid tiers include the same data, just at different frequencies. If your strategy isn't particularly price sensitive and doesn't need volume as a variable then you'll probably be fine wtih the free tier, however if you need to see a more granular view of the market then you should probably consider the paid advanced or pro tiers. A full catalogue of the values included in each data tier is available here . Basic Advanced Pro 1 minute intervals last traded price no volume 1 second intervals price ladder volume API tick intervals (50ms) price ladder volume Purchasing the data \u00b6 Start by going to the Betfair Historic Data site and log in using your Betfair account. Note: if you have less than 100 Betfair points you may have problems downloading data. On the Home page select the data set you want to download. Free data You need to 'purchase' the data set you want to download, even if it's from the free tier You can only 'purchase' each time period of data once. For example, if you had previously 'purchased' all Greyhound data for January 2018, then tried to download Greyhound data for January to March 2018 you would receive an error, and would need to purchase the data for February to March instead. Once you 'purchase' your choice of data it's recommended that you go to the My Data page, and choose the subset of data to then download. Downloading the data \u00b6 On the My Data page you can filter the purchased data to the actual markets you're interested in. You can filter by Sport, Date range, EventId, Event Name, Market Type, Country & File Type (M = market, E = Event), which will cut down the size of the data you need to download. For example, if you wanted the win market for Australian and New Zealand greyhound races you'd use these filters. File type The file type filter has two options that you can choose from: E = Event - includes event level data, i.e. Geelong greyhounds on x date M = Market - includes market level data, i.e. the win market for Geelong greyhounds race 3 on x date The site can be pretty slow to download from, and you'll generally have a better experience if you download the data a bit at a time, say month by month. Alternatively if you're going to download a lot of data it might be worth having a look at the historic data API, that can automate the download process and speed it up significantly. There's a guide available here , and some sample code the help get you started. Unzipping the files \u00b6 You'll need to download a program to unzip the TAR files. Here we'll be using 7Zip , which is free, open source and generally well respected. Once you've downloaded it make sure you also instal it onto the computer you'll be using to open the data files. Locate the data.tar file in your computer's file explorer program. Right click on the file, select '7-Zip' from the menu then choose 'Extract files...'. In the model that pops up change the pathmode to 'No pathnames'. You can also change the name and/or path of the folder you want the files extracted to if you want to. You now have a collection of .bz2 files. The final step is to select all the files, right click, select '7-Zip' from the menu then choose 'Extract here'. This will then extract all the individual zipped files which you can then either open in a text editor - you can use something basic like Notepad (installed on basically all computers by default) or a more complete program like Visual Studio Code (my go to), Vim or Notepad++ - or you can parse over the using a program to do the work for you. We'll explore how to parse the data another time. If you're opening the files with a text editor you might need to right click, choose 'open with' and select your preferred program. What's it for? \u00b6 The data available on the Historic Data site is extensive, and can be a really valuable tool or input. For example, you can include some of the columns as variables in a predictive model, compare BSP odds against win rates, or determine the average length of time it takes for 2 year old horses to run 1200m at Geelong. Quality data underpins the vast majority of successful betting strategies, so becoming comfortable working with the data available to you is a really important part of both the modelling and automation processes.

This makes them ideal for automation, where you use a program to place bets on your behalf while you get on with other things. Bet Angel Pro has a spreadsheet functionality that lets you place bets using your own variables and information from the live market, which is what I've used here to automate these ratings. There are so many different ways to use this part of Bet Angel and I'm very open to any thoughts about more effecitve ways of implementing this sort of strategy. You're welcome to reach out to me on bdp@betfair.com.au with your feedback and opinions. The plan \u00b6 I'm using the Greyhound Ratings Model put together by some of my Data Scientist colleagues. This model creates ratings for Victorian greyhound races daily and is freely available on the Hub. It's pretty good at predicting winners, so I'm going to place back bets on the dogs with shorter ratings where the market price is better than the model's rating. Bet Angel Pro's 'Guardian' feature has the capacity to let you create spreadsheets with pretty complicated rules that can be applied to multiple markets, which is what I've used for the automation here. Here I'll step through how I went about getting Bet Angel Pro to place bets using the ratings from Betfair's DataScientists' Greyhound Ratings Model . Once it's set up the goal is to be able to upload a new set of ratings, choose your races, set the program running and be able to walk away. Resources Tips: Betfair Data Scientists' Greyhound Ratings Model Rules: here's the spreadsheet I set up with my macros and rules included, but you'll obviously need to tweak it to suit your strategy and the format of your ratings Tool: Bet Angel Pro Set up \u00b6 Make sure you've downloaded and installed Bet Angel Pro, and signed in. Once you open the program up click on the 'G' Guardian icon and open the Guardian functionality up. Finding & formatting ratings \u00b6 Here I'm using the ratings shared by our Data Scientists on the Hub . This makes for a bit of prep work, copying the list of runners and their rating into an Excel spreadsheet. As a minimum you'll need a list of runner names (including the runner number followed by a full stop, i.e. 1. Runner Name) in one column and their rating in another in an Excel sheet. If you have a list of ratings already in a spreadsheet that's even better - you'll be able to tweak the Excel formulas to work with whatever format your data is in. Wherever your ratings come from, you'll need to include them in the spreadsheet you're using to interact wtih Bet Angel. Here I'm using a spreadsheet I edited for this strategy ), and I've included a tab called RATINGS where you can copy in the runner names and ratings. Writing a rule \u00b6 As with any automated strategy, one of the most important steps is deciding what logical approach you want to take, and writing rules that suit. I'm using a customised version of the default Bet Angel template Excel sheet to implement my strategy, so it can make betting decisions based on my ratings. Excel is an excellent tool, but it can take an investment of time to be able to use it effectively. This is how I used Excel to implement my set of rules. Trigger to place bet \u00b6 In short, I want to back runners when: the available to back price is better than the rating for that runner by at least 10% they have a rating less than 5 the scheduled event start time is less than 2 minutes away there isn't a bet already placed on the runner the event isn't in play This is my trigger on Excel formula: Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Stepping through each step: Price > rating: check whether the available to back price is better tha the runner's rating multipled by 1.1 (10%) - it does this by using the runner name in column B and looking up the corresponding rating from the RATINGS sheet =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Rating < 5: check whether the runner's rating is less than 5 (because I only want to bet on the favourite few runners) =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Time < 2: check whether the seconds left on the countdown are smaller than 120 (2 minutes), as the majority of markets don't fully form until the last few minutes before the off. This one's a bit complicated, as the time is actually returned as a percentage of a 24 hour day, which you need to convert into positive or negative seconds. You can read about the formula here or just keep it simple by referencing the value in cell E4 of Sheet2. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) No existing bet: checking whether a bet's already been placed on the runner (a number show in column AB when there's a bet on that runner) =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Not in play: checking whether the event has gone in play - as odds change so much in the run I only want to use this strategy pre-play. If this cell is blank it means it's not displaying the 'in-play' flag, so it's safe to place. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Result: if all of this is true, the formula returns \"BACK\", at which point the bet will trigger, otherwise the cell will stay blank and nothing will happen =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Excel functions IF statement: IF(if this is true,do this,else do this) AND statement: AND(this is true,so is this,so is this) - returns true or false Absolute references: if you're copy/pasting forumlas it's important that you make links absolute when you don't want the cell being referenced to change relative to the new cell the foruma is being pasted into. Preparing the spreadsheet \u00b6 You need to copy/paste these three formulas in the relevant cell on each green row - I did a few extra rows than the runner in the markets I was looking at, just in case. Excel is clever enough to automatically update the relative links in the formulas, so you should be able to copy/paste the same formula in each cell. Trigger bet rule This is the trigger on Excel formula we created earlier, and it needs to go in column L (L9 for the first runner). Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Odds Initially I was using the rating as the price, but I got a bet placement error for some of the selections - eventually I realised that the odds need to be valid Betfair 'ticks' . For simplicity's sake I'm now just using the current back odds (cell G9 for the first runner). This goes in column M (M9 for the first runner). =G9 Stake It's up to you what staking approach you want to take. I've kept it simple, and am using a 'to win' strategy. Each bet aims to win $10 at the currently available odds. The formula divides $10 by the current available best back odds (cell G9 for the first runner) minus one to get the stake required to win $10. This goes in column N (N9 for the first runner). =10/(G9-1) Selecting markets \u00b6 I used the markets menu to navigate to the tracks I have ratings for, then multi-slected all the win markets by holding down the control key and clicking on each win market. If you wanted to include all horse or greyhound races for a day you could use the 'quick picks' tab. Once you've chosen the races you're interested in click the 'add' button and you'll see them appear in the main body of the screen. Linking the spreadsheet \u00b6 Open the 'Excel' tab in Guardian, then use the browse functionality to choose the spreadsheet you've been working on. From there, click on 'open workbook', then make sure you have 'connect', 'auto-bind Bet Angel sheets and 'auto-clear Bet Angel bindings' all selected. Bet Angel features \u00b6 Here are some Bet Angel features that you'll need to consider: Clearing status cells: if there is a value in the status cell then no bets will place for that runner, to avoid placing duplicate bets accidentally. As we want to use the same sheet for multiple races, and our bet trigger rule includes a check to see whether we already have a bet on the runner, I created a macro in the Excel sheet that auto-clears the status cells every 5 seconds. This was based on some logic I found in a forum discussion on Bet Angel . Turning off bet confirmation: unless you want to manually confirm each individual bet placed (which you definitely might want to leave turned on until you feel comfortable that the program and strategy are behaving as you expect) you'll need to go into the 'Settings' tab on the main Bet Angel Pro program, click 'Edit settings', go to the 'Behaviour' tab, and remove the tick at the top next to 'Confirm Bets?'. You can then save these settings, but you'll need to go into the settings tab and choose the saved file each time you open the program. Editing the spreadsheet: the spreadsheet really doesn't like it when you try and edit it 'live' - make sure you untick 'connect' on the Excel tab in Guardian while you're editing the spreadsheet, save changes, then tick 'connect' again when you've finished your edits. Areas for improvement \u00b6 There are parts of this approach that I'm still trying to get to work to my liking, and I'll update this article as I find better solutions. If you have any suggestions for improvements please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au - I'd love to hear your thoughts. For example, the spreadsheet only binds with one market at a time, so if one market gets delayed and runs overtime the program won't be able to move on to the next market - I missed some races because of this. And you're set! \u00b6 Once you've set your spreadsheet set up and you're comfortable using Bet Angel Pro it should only take a number of seconds to load your markets and ratings up and set your strategy running for the day. Note: you will need to leave your computer up and running for the duration of the chosen markets, as the program needs the computer to be 'awake' to be able to run. What next? \u00b6 We're working through some of the popular automation tools and creating articles like this one to help you learn how to use them to implement different styles of strategies. If you have any thoughts or feedback on this article or other programs you'd like to see us explore please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au Disclaimer \u00b6 Note that whilst automated strategies are fun and rewarding to create, we can't promise that your betting strategy will be profitable. If you're implementing your own strategies please gamble responsibly and note that you are responsible for any winnings/losses incurred.","title":"Bet Angel - Ratings Automation"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#bet-angel-ratings-automation","text":"","title":"Bet Angel - Ratings Automation"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#automating-a-ratings-based-strategy-using-bet-angel-pro","text":"Ratings are the basis for a lot of betting strategies, but they can be paricularly painful and time-consuming to implement manually.

This is how I used Excel to implement my set of rules.","title":"Writing a rule"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#trigger-to-place-bet","text":"In short, I want to back runners when: the available to back price is better than the rating for that runner by at least 10% they have a rating less than 5 the scheduled event start time is less than 2 minutes away there isn't a bet already placed on the runner the event isn't in play This is my trigger on Excel formula: Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Stepping through each step: Price > rating: check whether the available to back price is better tha the runner's rating multipled by 1.1 (10%) - it does this by using the runner name in column B and looking up the corresponding rating from the RATINGS sheet =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Rating < 5: check whether the runner's rating is less than 5 (because I only want to bet on the favourite few runners) =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Time < 2: check whether the seconds left on the countdown are smaller than 120 (2 minutes), as the majority of markets don't fully form until the last few minutes before the off. This one's a bit complicated, as the time is actually returned as a percentage of a 24 hour day, which you need to convert into positive or negative seconds. You can read about the formula here or just keep it simple by referencing the value in cell E4 of Sheet2. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) No existing bet: checking whether a bet's already been placed on the runner (a number show in column AB when there's a bet on that runner) =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Not in play: checking whether the event has gone in play - as odds change so much in the run I only want to use this strategy pre-play. If this cell is blank it means it's not displaying the 'in-play' flag, so it's safe to place. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Result: if all of this is true, the formula returns \"BACK\", at which point the bet will trigger, otherwise the cell will stay blank and nothing will happen =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Excel functions IF statement: IF(if this is true,do this,else do this) AND statement: AND(this is true,so is this,so is this) - returns true or false Absolute references: if you're copy/pasting forumlas it's important that you make links absolute when you don't want the cell being referenced to change relative to the new cell the foruma is being pasted into.","title":"Trigger to place bet"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#preparing-the-spreadsheet","text":"You need to copy/paste these three formulas in the relevant cell on each green row - I did a few extra rows than the runner in the markets I was looking at, just in case. Excel is clever enough to automatically update the relative links in the formulas, so you should be able to copy/paste the same formula in each cell. Trigger bet rule This is the trigger on Excel formula we created earlier, and it needs to go in column L (L9 for the first runner). Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Odds Initially I was using the rating as the price, but I got a bet placement error for some of the selections - eventually I realised that the odds need to be valid Betfair 'ticks' . For simplicity's sake I'm now just using the current back odds (cell G9 for the first runner). This goes in column M (M9 for the first runner). =G9 Stake It's up to you what staking approach you want to take. I've kept it simple, and am using a 'to win' strategy. Each bet aims to win $10 at the currently available odds. The formula divides $10 by the current available best back odds (cell G9 for the first runner) minus one to get the stake required to win $10. This goes in column N (N9 for the first runner). =10/(G9-1)","title":"Preparing the spreadsheet"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#selecting-markets","text":"I used the markets menu to navigate to the tracks I have ratings for, then multi-slected all the win markets by holding down the control key and clicking on each win market.

As we want to use the same sheet for multiple races, and our bet trigger rule includes a check to see whether we already have a bet on the runner, I created a macro in the Excel sheet that auto-clears the status cells every 5 seconds. This was based on some logic I found in a forum discussion on Bet Angel . Turning off bet confirmation: unless you want to manually confirm each individual bet placed (which you definitely might want to leave turned on until you feel comfortable that the program and strategy are behaving as you expect) you'll need to go into the 'Settings' tab on the main Bet Angel Pro program, click 'Edit settings', go to the 'Behaviour' tab, and remove the tick at the top next to 'Confirm Bets?'. You can then save these settings, but you'll need to go into the settings tab and choose the saved file each time you open the program. Editing the spreadsheet: the spreadsheet really doesn't like it when you try and edit it 'live' - make sure you untick 'connect' on the Excel tab in Guardian while you're editing the spreadsheet, save changes, then tick 'connect' again when you've finished your edits.","title":"Bet Angel features"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#areas-for-improvement","text":"There are parts of this approach that I'm still trying to get to work to my liking, and I'll update this article as I find better solutions. If you have any suggestions for improvements please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au - I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Wouldn't it be easier if you could take those tips and get a program to automatically place the bets on your behalf? This is what we're going to explore here - we'll be using Bet Angel Pro to place bets automatically based on a set of tips. This is my first time using Bet Angel for this approach, and am very open to any thoughts about more effecitve ways of implementing this sort of strategy. You're welcome to reach out to me on bdp@betfair.com.au with your feedback and opinions. The plan \u00b6 I have a set of tips that I've taken from our DataScientists' Racing Prediction Model, but this approach should work for any set of tips have. My goal is to create an automated process which will let me choose my tips for the day, then walk away and the the program do the leg work. Here I'll step through how I went about getting Bet Angel Pro to place bets on the favourite runner identified by Betfair's DataScientists . There are no ratings associated wtih these tips, so I'm happy to take Betfair's Starting Price instead of a price for these bets. Bet Angel Pro's 'Guardian' feature has the capacity to let you create rules that can then be applied to specific selections, which is how we're going to implement this strategy. After digging around on Bet Angel's forum and blog , I found an article on how to create a generic automation rule , which I found useful in helping me learn how to use the tool to automate these tips. I also found a rule that someone else had written to back or lay a selection at BSP , which is what I used as the basis for the rule I'm using here . If you want to follow along and try this approach yourself you'll need to download Bet Angel Pro and sign up for either a subscription or at least a test period.

Resources Tips: Betfair Data Scientists' Racing Prediction Model Rules: rule file , based on Bet Angel Automation - Horse racing - Pre off : Back or Lay at Betfair SP Guardian Automation Bot Tool: Bet Angel Pro Set up \u00b6 First up we need to make sure we've downloaded and installed Bet Angel Pro, and signed in. Once you open the program up click on the 'G' Guardian icon and open the Guardian functionality up. I've created an automated rule that you can download here, roughly based on the one discussed in this forum post (note: you will need to create a Bet Angel forum account to be able to download the rule). Setting up your rules \u00b6 open up the 'Automation' tab click 'import a rule' navigate to the rule file you just downloaded (probably in your Downloads folder by default) upload the rule click on the 'rules file name' and select the rule file you just uploaded You can choose to change the bet stake and other parts of the rule by: clicking on 'edit rules file', selecting the rule you want to change (i.e. back at SP) click on the 'parameters' tab change the stake as desired Turning off bet confirmation Unless you want to manually confirm each individual bet placed (which you definitely might want to leave turned on until you feel comfortable that the program and strategy are behaving as you expect) you'll need to go into the 'Settings' tab on the main Bet Angel Pro program, click 'Edit settings', go to the 'Behaviour' tab, and remove the tick at the top next to 'Confirm Bets?'. You can then save these settings, but you'll need to go into the settings tab and choose the saved file each time you open the program. Selecting your markets \u00b6 I decided I only wanted to bet on the gallops races at Geelong, so I used the markets menu to navigate to Geelong, then multi-slected all the win markets by holding down the control key and clicking on each win market. If you wanted to include all horse or greyhound races for a day you could use the 'quick picks' tab. Once you've chosen the races you're interested in click the 'add' button and you'll see them appear in the main body of the screen. Choosing your selections \u00b6 The final step is to choose which selections you want to bet on. In this example I just chose the number 1 selection chosen by the Data Scientists in their Racing Prediction Model . Just click on the dropdown in the 'Automation Nomination Selection 1' column for each race and choose your selection. Back and lay bets: The runner selected in 'Automation Nomination Selection 1' will have a BSP back bet for your chosen stake placed. The runner selected in 'Automation Nomination Selection 2' will have a BSP lay bet for your chosen stake placed. Changing the rules This approach only allows you to back one runner and lay one runner per race. If your strategy bets on multiple runners per race you can edit the rules file, select 'copy rule', then edit the second rule to use the runner selected in 'Automation Nomination Selection 2 and delete the lay strategy. The beauty of this tool is that you can customise the rules until you have a set that do what you want them to. And you're set! \u00b6 Once you've set your rules up and got comfortable using Bet Angel Pro it should only take number of seconds to load the markets up and choose your selections for the day.
